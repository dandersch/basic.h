TODO -*- mode: org -*-

idea: put together a replacement for the c standard library, consisting of own
code & public domain libraries
  
- [X] one .h that includes other .h files w/ BASIC_IMPLEMENTATION
- [X] should include base.h (mostly for typedefs, compiler definitions...)
- [0/4] MACROS:
  + [X] ASSERT()
  + [ ] STATIC_ASSERT()
  + [ ] UNREACHABLE()
  + [ ] PANIC()
- [ ] custom memory arena w/ allocator
- [ ] hashmap library (use own?)
- [ ] dynamic array
- [ ] custom imgui
- [ ] custom debug utils & macros like
  + [ ] logging
  + [ ] asserts
  + [ ] unreachable, panic, unimplemented
- [0/3] a string replacement (no null terminated strings) w/ functions:
  + [ ] isalnum()
  + [ ] iswhitespace()
  + [ ] how to (s|f)printf()?
- [X] lerp functions (/macros)
- [X] clamp functions
- [X] min/max functions
- [X] linear remap (map val in range x to y to equivalent val in range a to b),
      implement with unlerp in the first range and then lerp in the second range
- [ ] sorting algorithms
- [ ] random number generator for (signed/unsigned) ints and float
- [0/3] functions for file and filepaths
  + [ ] our own file struct?
  + [ ] getparent()
  + [ ] splitpath()
- [ ] custom introspection library
- [ ] json parser
- [ ] way to get a window up crossplatform
- [ ] cross platform event system
- [ ] crossplatform audio library (miniaudio?)
- [ ] custom, crossplatform opengl loader
- [ ] custom, opengl 2d renderer
- [ ] stb_img, stb_truetype
- ...
