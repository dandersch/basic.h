TODO -*- mode: org -*-

idea: put together a replacement for the c standard library, consisting of own
code & public domain libraries
  
- [X] one .h that includes other .h files w/ BASIC_IMPLEMENTATION
- [X] should include base.h (mostly for typedefs, compiler definitions...)
- [X] lerp functions (/macros)
- [X] clamp functions
- [X] min/max functions
- [X] linear remap (map val in range x to y to equivalent val in range a to b), implement with unlerp in the first range and then lerp in the second range
- [ ] memory arena
- [ ] hashmap
- [ ] dynamic array
- [ ] custom imgui
- [ ] logging
- [ ] a string replacement (no null terminated strings)
- [ ] sorting algorithms
- [ ] random number generator for (signed/unsigned) ints and float
- [ ] filepaths functions: getparent(), splitpath()
- [ ] introspection with registrars
- [ ] json/csv/... parser
- [ ] way to get a window up crossplatform
- [ ] cross platform event system
- [ ] crossplatform audio library (miniaudio?)
- [ ] custom, crossplatform opengl loader
- [ ] custom, opengl 2d renderer
- [ ] stb_img, stb_truetype
